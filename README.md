# p_test

## API

test 1:

Mountain Peak (backend)

The context of this test is to provide a simple web service for storing and retrieving mountain peaks.

Using API framework of your choice, implement the following features:
 

- models/db tables for storing a peak location and attribute: lat, lon, altitude, name

- REST api endpoints to :

    * create/read/update/delete a peak

    * retrieve a list of peaks in a given geographical bounding box

test 2:

Add mongo db to store some documentation on each peak (name, height, ...)

test3 (wip):

make schemas for peak data store in mongo
add tests for data unicity
deploy on docker
